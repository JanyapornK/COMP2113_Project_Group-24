## What is this application?
We have collectively decided to code an RPG adventure video game. The game's premise is that the player attempts to steal exam papers from the professor's office and escape, defeating opponents and tackling mazes along the way.

Please note that this project is made for entertainment and educational purposes only, and the creators do not condone such behaviour.

## Features fulfilling coding requirements:
**Generation of random:** Create random seed to roll the dice, determining battle outcomes and the overall cornerstone for the project
  
**Data structures for storing data:** Define a class to store the character status

**Dynamic memory management:** Dynamically manage the memory in "room.cpp", "maze.cpp"

**File input/output:** Save game progress to the "savegame.txt"

**Program codes in multiple files:** main.cpp character.cpp room.cpp battle.cpp maze.cpp, etc

**Tech used:** C++ and makefile
