## What is this application?
Welcome to HKU Mission Impossible, a text-based adventure that plunges you into a high-stakes campus quest. Rumor has it that the professor’s missing office key grants access to invaluable exam papers —— an opportunity that no ambitious student can ignore. As you step into the role of a daring protagonist, your goal is clear: find the key, outsmart the guards, face the final challenge, and secure your academic advantage.

At the start, you’ll choose from three unique character types —— Athlete, Hacker, or Rebel —— each offering distinctive attributes and special abilities. The Athlete’s raw strength can double damage in battle, the Hacker can cleverly skip entire conflicts, and the Rebel bypasses obstacles with cunning lock-picking skills. Your choice shapes not only your strategy but also your entire journey, as certain paths will become easier or harder —— based on your strengths.

The adventure unfolds in multiple phases:

Key Hunt:
Explore different rooms scattered across campus, each guarded by unpredictable opponents. Should you face them head-on or try to outwit them? Your character’s stats —— Attack, Defence, Intelligence —— and your chosen tactics determine the outcome of every encounter.

Mazes & Mysteries:
Once you’ve acquired the key (or circumvented the need for one, if you’re a Rebel), navigate treacherous mazes that test your wits and nerve. Using simple directional commands, you’ll attempt to avoid dead ends and find your way forward.

The Final Showdown:
At the heart of this mission awaits the formidable Professor. Armed with heightened stats and cunning intelligence, this final boss demands skillful combat and strategic thinking. Win, and you claim the exam papers as your prize.

The Great Escape:
Victory isn’t the end. With the papers in hand, you must navigate a second maze to exit the building and seal your success. Only then can you bask in the glory of a well-earned academic edge.
